# JavaInterface

Create one interface Shape with two member functions

public double perimeterCalculation();

public double areaCalculation();

Create class Circle which uses Shape interface with one attribute double radius.

Create class Ellipse which uses Shape interface with two attributes double majorRadius and double minorRadius. Override interface’s methods in both the classes. In Main class with main() you need to declare reference of Shape. You need to enter a comma String. If the String is 15,0 then system will automatically attach the Shape reference to Circle object . Again if input is 15,10 then Shape reference refers to Ellipse object. Finally you need to display area and perimeter of respective shape.
